Since I got covid last week, I was granted one week extension for assignment 4
There are three ipynb python code file. 
Assignment_4_Ex1.ipynb for Ex1(not essential)

for Ex1, open the file in jupyter notebook, then choose run all in the menu, to get the result.
for Ex2, open a terminal and run python randomize.py -f (file name) -s (support) -p (possiblity) to get the result

MBDAssignment 4.pdf is the formal submmission, should submmited individually. Backup in case.

Hope you are satisfied.
